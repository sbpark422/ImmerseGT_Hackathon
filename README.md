Inspiration: 

- Object Odyssey is a therapeutic platform that provides stimulating puzzles to alleviate negative symptoms related to ADHD.
- ADHD affects 6 million children in the US population. Children with ADHD struggle with motivation, working memory, and paying attention.
- OO was implemented on a VR platform because VR offers an immersive environment free of distractions.
- OO was built on Unity and tested on Oculus Quest 2.
- The main challenge was choosing the most impactful puzzles that will support negative symptoms related to ADHD.
- Individual components used in our project have been supported by scientific evidence. However, a large double blind study should be conducted to test the effectiveness of this project.
