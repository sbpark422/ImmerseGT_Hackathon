Project Description:

ADHD affects 6 million children in the US, negatively impacting attention, motivation, and working memory. Object Odyssey is a therapeutic platform that provides stimulating puzzles to alleviate negative symptoms related to ADHD. Object Odyssey was built on Unity for Oculus Quest 2. VR was chosen because VR offers an immersive stimulating environment. The main challenge was choosing the most impactful puzzles that will support negative symptoms related to ADHD. Individual components used in our project have been supported by scientific evidence. However, a large double-blind study should be conducted to test the effectiveness of this project.

Inspiration: 

- Object Odyssey is a therapeutic platform that provides stimulating puzzles to alleviate negative symptoms related to ADHD.
- ADHD affects 6 million children in the US population. Children with ADHD struggle with motivation, working memory, and paying attention.
- OO was implemented on a VR platform because VR offers an immersive environment free of distractions.
- OO was built on Unity and tested on Oculus Quest 2.
- The main challenge was choosing the most impactful puzzles that will support negative symptoms related to ADHD.
- Individual components used in our project have been supported by scientific evidence. However, a large double blind study should be conducted to test the effectiveness of this project.

Primary Target users: people with mental health disorders, including schizophrenia.

Stakeholders: Hospital, Therapy Center for users with Schizophrenia who has mental disorders

- Schizophrenia is a complex mental health disorder, and the specific activities that may be helpful can vary depending on the individual's needs and symptoms. So our goal is to provide cognitive remediation games to improve their cognitive function and ability to manage daily tasks.
- Cognitive remediation therapy(CRT) can help individuals with schizophrenia to improve their cognitive function and ability to manage daily tasks. Activities such as memory games, problem-solving tasks, and computer-based exercises may be used.
- We are providing these VR games as part of cognitive remediation therapy (CRT). Virtual reality games can provide a more immersive and engaging experience compared to traditional paper-and-pencil or computer-based exercises, making it a more enjoyable and motivating activity for individuals undergoing CRT. VR games can also be tailored to target specific cognitive functions that need improvement, such as attention, memory, and problem-solving.
- Studies have shown that VR-based cognitive remediation therapy can lead to significant improvements in cognitive functioning, as well as social functioning and overall quality of life in individuals with schizophrenia.

- Cognitive Enhancement Training (CET) is a form of cognitive remediation therapy that aims to improve cognitive functioning in individuals with mental health conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. CET typically involves computer-based training exercises that are designed to improve cognitive skills such as attention, memory, and executive functioning.
